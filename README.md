# Exploration of Prosper Loan Dataset
## by Joshua Ati


## Dataset

> Prosper is a personal loan pioneer â€” the company became the first firm to enter the peer-to-peer lending arena when it launched in 2005. Prosper has originated more than $20 billion in personal loans by matching over 1,170,000 borrowers to potential investors through its online platform. The Dataset has 81 Loan Variables and 113,937 Loan Observations. In my exploration, I focused on what affects the Interest Rate of the Borrower


## Summary of Findings

> - 2013 had the highest number of loan collected by a very large margin. 2012 with the second highest number of loans collected had a difference of -13%
- A majority of loans are still current while a lot are completed, defaulted or charged off
- Most loans were taken by individuals within the $25,000-49,99 and $50,000-74,999 income range
- Most loans had between 0 and 50 investors
- In general, home owners have lower interest rate than those that don't own homes. 
- There is a positive correlation between the loan amount and the monthly loan payment
- Higher income individuals have access to higher loan amounts


## Key Insights for Presentation

> After analysing the borrower's interest rate against all useable variables, I discovered that the people with the most advantage are people that are employed, have homes, are deemed low risk, have a higher income range and access one year loans. They get the lowest interest rate and are likely to get higher loan amounts.
